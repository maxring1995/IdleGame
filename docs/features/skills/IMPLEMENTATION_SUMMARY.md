## XP Progression Formula

**Runescape-inspired exponential curve:**
```typescript
function calculateXPForLevel(targetLevel: number): number {
  if (targetLevel <= 1) return 0
  let totalXP = 0
  for (let lvl = 2; lvl <= targetLevel; lvl++) {
    const levelXP = Math.floor(lvl + 300 * Math.pow(2, lvl / 7.0))
    totalXP += levelXP
  }
  return Math.floor(totalXP / 4)
}
```

**Key Milestones:**
- Level 10: 1,154 XP
- Level 50: 101,333 XP
- Level 99: 13,034,431 XP
