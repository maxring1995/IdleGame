## UI/UX Improvements

### 📋 Renamed "Contracts" → "Gathering Contracts"
**Status**: ✅ Complete

Renamed the "Contracts" feature to "Gathering Contracts" for clarity and moved it from the Market tab to the Adventure tab for better logical grouping.

**Changes**:
- ✅ Renamed "Contracts" to "Gathering Contracts" throughout the UI
- ✅ Moved from Market tab to Adventure tab as 4th sub-tab
- ✅ Updated type definitions and navigation structure
- ✅ Updated Quick Actions default shortcuts
- ✅ Updated Quick Actions settings modal

**Before**:
```
Market Tab
├── Merchant
└── Contracts
```

**After**:
```
Adventure Tab
├── Exploration
├── Combat
├── Quests
└── Gathering Contracts  ← Moved here

Market Tab
└── Merchant (no sub-tabs)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `components/Game.tsx` - Tab structure and navigation

**Rationale**:
- Gathering Contracts are more aligned with Adventure/Exploration activities
- Market tab now focuses solely on buying/selling items (Merchant)
- Clearer separation of concerns between trading and gathering activities

---

## Bug Fixes

### 🔧 Equipment Manager Z-Index Issue
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

**Problem**: Equipment Manager overlay not appearing when opened from Character Tab.

**Root Cause**: Parent container in `Game.tsx` uses CSS transform (`scale-100`) which creates a new stacking context, breaking `fixed` positioning for child overlays.

**Solution**: Increased `EquipmentOverlay` z-index from `z-50` to `z-[9999]` to ensure it renders above all content layers.

**Files Modified**:
- `components/EquipmentOverlay.tsx:233`

**Change**:
```diff
- <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/90 backdrop-blur-md z-50 flex flex-col">
+ <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/90 backdrop-blur-md z-[9999] flex flex-col">
```

**Impact**: Equipment Manager now displays correctly when opened from any location in the Character tab.

---

## Technical Details

### New Helper Functions

**`lib/characterStats.ts`**:

1. **`calculateStatBreakdown(character, equippedItems, activeBuffs)`**
   - Calculates comprehensive stat breakdown for all character stats
   - Returns object with base, equipment, buffs, and total values for each stat

2. **`formatStatWithSources(statName, breakdown)`**
   - Formats stat breakdown into human-readable text
   - Example: "Base: 50 | Equipment: +80 | Buffs: +20"

3. **`getEquipmentContribution(equippedItems)`**
   - Returns array of equipment contributions by slot
   - Includes item name, rarity, and stat bonuses

4. **`getTotalEquipmentStats(equippedItems)`**
   - Sums all equipment bonuses into single object
   - Used for equipment stats summary display

5. **`formatDuration(startDate)`**
   - Formats time duration for playtime display
   - Returns strings like "2h 30m" or "5d 12h"

### Type Definitions Updated

**`components/Game.tsx`**:
```typescript
// Updated types
type AdventureSubTab = 'exploration' | 'combat' | 'quests' | 'gathering_contracts'
type MarketSubTab = 'merchant'  // Removed 'contracts'
```

### Data Flow

**Character Stats Component**:
1. Mount → Load equipped items, buffs, skills
2. Calculate stats using `calculateStatBreakdown()`

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

**If you have custom quick actions saved in localStorage**:
- Old quick action with `{ tab: 'market', subTab: 'contracts' }` will no longer work
- Update to `{ tab: 'adventure', subTab: 'gathering_contracts', label: 'Gathering Contracts', icon: '📋' }`
- Or clear localStorage and reconfigure quick actions

**Type checking**:
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode passes
- No new ESLint warnings introduced
- All imports resolve correctly

### For Users

**No breaking changes**:
- All existing functionality preserved
- Character data unchanged
- Equipment and inventory work as before
- Gathering Contracts accessible in new location

**New capabilities**:
- Character Stats panel provides deep insight into character power
- Better understanding of stat sources and bonuses
- Visual feedback for active buffs and their durations

---

## Performance Impact

**Character Stats System**:
- Minimal performance impact
- Stat calculations are lightweight (< 1ms)
- Buff polling every 2 seconds (low network overhead)
- Component only renders when visible

**Tab Structure Changes**:
- No performance impact
- Same number of components rendered
- Navigation logic unchanged

**Overall**: No measurable performance degradation

---

## Future Improvements

### Character Stats Enhancements
1. Stat comparison tool (compare different equipment loadouts)
2. DPS calculator for combat effectiveness
3. Historical stat tracking with graphs
4. Exportable character sheets
5. Buff management (cancel, queue, conflict warnings)

### Tab Structure
1. Consider adding more Adventure sub-tabs (Dungeons, Raids, etc.)
2. Potentially split Market into Buy/Sell tabs if merchant grows
3. Add visual indicators for active tasks per tab
