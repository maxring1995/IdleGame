# Phase 3: Combat System - Implementation Summary ‚úÖ

**Status:** COMPLETE & DEPLOYED
**Completed:** October 2, 2025
**Deployment:** Live at http://localhost:3000

---

## üéØ Objective

Implement a complete turn-based combat system that leverages the existing character stats and equipment system to provide engaging gameplay.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### Database Schema
**New Tables:**
- `enemies` - Enemy catalog with 7 starter enemies
- `combat_logs` - Historical combat records
- `active_combat` - Current battle state tracking

**Enemies Added:**
- **Tier 1 (Beginner):** Slime, Goblin Scout, Wild Wolf
- **Tier 2 (Intermediate):** Orc Warrior, Dark Mage
- **Tier 3 (Advanced):** Troll, Dragon Whelp

### Backend Functions

**Enemy Management** (`lib/enemies.ts`):
- `getAvailableEnemies(playerLevel)` - Filter enemies by player level
- `getEnemyById(id)` - Fetch specific enemy
- `getEnemiesByLevel(min, max)` - Range-based filtering
- `getRecommendedEnemies(playerLevel)` - Suggested enemies for player

**Combat Logic** (`lib/combat.ts`):
- `startCombat(characterId, enemyId)` - Initialize battle
- `executeTurn(characterId)` - Process attack rounds
- `endCombat(characterId, victory)` - Distribute rewards/penalties
- `calculateDamage(attack, defense)` - Damage formula with variance
- `rollLoot(lootTable)` - Probability-based drops
- `rollGold(min, max)` - Random gold rewards
- `getActiveCombat(characterId)` - Resume ongoing battles
- `getCombatHistory(characterId)` - View past battles
- `abandonCombat(characterId)` - Flee from battle

### UI Components

**Combat Interface:**
- `Combat.tsx` - Main combat controller
- `EnemyList.tsx` - Enemy selection grid with difficulty indicators
- `CombatLog.tsx` - Real-time action feed with auto-scroll
- `VictoryModal.tsx` - Rewards display for victory/defeat

**Features:**
- Health bars with real-time updates
- Turn-by-turn combat log
- Difficulty indicators (Easy, Moderate, Fair Fight, Challenging, Hard)
- Flee option during battle
- Combat statistics display

### Game Integration

**Added to Game.tsx:**
- New "‚öîÔ∏è Combat" tab between Adventure and Inventory
- Seamless navigation between game sections
- Character state updates after combat

### Combat Mechanics

**Damage Calculation:**
```
baseDamage = attack - (defense / 2)
variance = random(0.85 to 1.15)  // ¬±15%
finalDamage = max(1, baseDamage * variance)
```

**Turn Flow:**
1. Player attacks first
2. Enemy counterattacks if still alive
3. Health updated, actions logged
4. Repeat until victory or defeat

**Rewards (Victory):**
- Experience points (scales with enemy level)
- Gold (random between min/max range)
- Loot drops (probability-based from enemy loot table)

**Penalties (Defeat):**
- Health reduced to 50% of maximum
- No rewards given

### TypeScript Types

**Added to `lib/supabase.ts`:**
- `Enemy` - Enemy data structure
- `CombatLog` - Battle history record
- `ActiveCombat` - Live battle state
- `CombatAction` - Individual combat action
- `CombatResult` - Battle outcome data

### Testing

**Unit Tests** (`lib/__tests__/combat.test.ts`):
- Damage calculation validation
- Gold roll range checks
- Loot drop probability testing
- Edge case handling

**E2E Tests** (`tests/combat.spec.ts`):
- Enemy list display
- Combat initiation
- Turn execution
- Victory/defeat flows
- Reward distribution
- Health bar updates
- Combat log functionality
- Difficulty indicators
- Flee mechanics
- Level restrictions
