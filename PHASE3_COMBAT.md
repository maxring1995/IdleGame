# Phase 3: Combat System 🗡️

**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2025-10-02
**Goal:** Implement an engaging combat system that leverages the existing equipment and stats system

---

## 📋 Overview

The combat system will provide the core gameplay loop for Eternal Realms. Players will battle enemies to gain experience, gold, and loot drops. Combat will be turn-based with automatic progression, fitting the idle game mechanics.

## ✅ Prerequisites (Already Completed)

- ✅ Character stats system (health, mana, attack, defense)
- ✅ Equipment system with stat bonuses
- ✅ Inventory management
- ✅ Experience and leveling system
- ✅ Gold currency system

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Enemy System**: Create diverse enemies with varying difficulty
2. **Combat Mechanics**: Turn-based combat with damage calculations
3. **Loot System**: Enemies drop gold, items, and experience
4. **Combat UI**: Visual feedback for battles and results
5. **Idle Integration**: Auto-battle functionality for idle gameplay
6. **Progression**: Unlock stronger enemies as player levels up

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New Tables

#### `enemies` - Enemy Catalog
```sql
- id (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY) - Unique enemy identifier (e.g., 'goblin', 'orc')
- name (TEXT) - Display name
- description (TEXT) - Enemy description
- level (INTEGER) - Enemy level
- health (INTEGER) - Base health
- attack (INTEGER) - Attack power
- defense (INTEGER) - Defense rating
- experience_reward (INTEGER) - XP given on defeat
- gold_min (INTEGER) - Minimum gold drop
- gold_max (INTEGER) - Maximum gold drop
- loot_table (JSONB) - Item drop chances { item_id: drop_rate }
- required_player_level (INTEGER) - Minimum level to encounter
- image_url (TEXT) - Enemy sprite/image
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

#### `combat_logs` - Combat History
```sql
- id (UUID, PRIMARY KEY)
- character_id (UUID, FK -> characters)
- enemy_id (TEXT, FK -> enemies)
- victory (BOOLEAN) - Did player win?
- damage_dealt (INTEGER) - Total damage by player
- damage_taken (INTEGER) - Total damage by enemy
- experience_gained (INTEGER) - XP earned
- gold_gained (INTEGER) - Gold earned
- items_looted (JSONB) - Array of item_ids dropped
- combat_duration_ms (INTEGER) - Battle length
- started_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- ended_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

#### `active_combat` - Current Battle State (Optional)
```sql
- character_id (UUID, PRIMARY KEY, FK -> characters)
- enemy_id (TEXT, FK -> enemies)
- player_current_health (INTEGER)
- enemy_current_health (INTEGER)
- turn_number (INTEGER)
- combat_log (JSONB) - Turn-by-turn actions
- started_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All combat-related tables will have RLS policies:
- Users can only view/modify their own combat data
- Enemy catalog is readable by all authenticated users

## ⚙️ Combat Mechanics

### Damage Calculation
```typescript
// Base damage formula
baseDamage = attacker.attack - defender.defense / 2
actualDamage = baseDamage * (0.85 to 1.15) // Random variance ±15%
finalDamage = Math.max(1, Math.floor(actualDamage)) // Minimum 1 damage
```

### Turn Order
1. Compare player speed vs enemy speed (future: for now, player goes first)
2. Player attacks enemy
3. Check if enemy is defeated
4. If not, enemy attacks player
5. Check if player is defeated
6. Repeat until one side wins

### Critical Hits (Future Enhancement)
- 10% base chance for 1.5x damage
- Can be increased with gear/skills

### Victory Conditions
- **Player Wins**: Enemy health reaches 0
  - Gain experience (with level-based multipliers)
  - Gain gold (random between min/max)
  - Roll for loot drops (based on loot_table probabilities)

- **Player Loses**: Player health reaches 0
  - No rewards
  - Player health restored to 50% (penalty)
  - Option to retry or return to town

## 🎨 UI Components

### Combat View (`components/Combat.tsx`)
- Enemy display (name, level, health bar)
- Player health/mana display
- Combat log (scrolling action feed)
- Attack button / Auto-battle toggle
- Victory/Defeat modal with rewards
- Loot display

### Enemy Selection (`components/EnemyList.tsx`)
- Grid of available enemies
- Level requirements and difficulty indicators
- Enemy stats preview
- "Challenge" button to start combat

### Combat Tab Integration
Add new tab to `components/Game.tsx`:
- Adventure (existing)
- **Combat** (new) ← Enemy selection & battle
- Inventory (existing)

### Difficulty Curve
- Player should defeat same-level enemies ~70% of the time
- 2 levels below = ~95% win rate (farming)
- 2 levels above = ~30% win rate (challenge)
